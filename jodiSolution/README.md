# Jodi's Test Submission

## Installation
If you have NVM installed, type:
```
nvm use
```
to use the node version this was built against.

Then you just need to run:
```
npm install
```

## How to use
To start the server, type:
```
npm start
```
This will start a server on port 3120. Going to any URL on http://localhost:3120/ with a web browser will produce the output.
